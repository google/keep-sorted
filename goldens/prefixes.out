preferred prefixes putting 'build_target' before 'branch_name':
  build_specs {

    build_target: "//foo/bar"
    build_target: "//foo/baz"
    branch_name: "dev"

Put the specified prefixes at the end:
  items = [
    # keep-sorted-test start prefix_order=,FOO,BAR
    BATS,
    DING,
    FOO,
    BAR
    # keep-sorted-test end
  ]

Case insensitive put the specified prefixes at the end:
  items = [
    # keep-sorted-test start case=no prefix_order=,foo,bar
    BATS,
    DING,
    FOO,
    BAR
    # keep-sorted-test end
  ]

Put a group of items in the beginning, another group at the end:
  // keep-sorted-test start prefix_order=INIT_,,FINAL_
  INIT_BAR,
  INIT_FOO,
  DO_MORE_STUFF,
  DO_STUFF,
  ZAP_THINGS,
  FINAL_BAR,
  FINAL_FOO
  // keep-sorted-test end

preferred prefixes with comments:
  build_specs {
    # keep-sorted-test start prefix_order=build_target,branch_name
    # raise the bar!
    build_target: "//foo/bar"
    build_target: "//foo/baz"
    # required for development.
    branch_name: "dev"
    branch_name: "prod"
